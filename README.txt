Button Functionality:
Press the button to cycle through button states; 1, 2, 5 10. These states change the sensitivity of the encoder.
Hold the button for 2 or more seconds to change the control state between open and closed loop (open on startup). 

LED Functionality:
Open loop is indicated by the green Bi-colour LED and closed loop is indicated by the red Bi-colour LED.
The other LED is on when the fan is being driven and off when the fan is not driven.

LCD Functionality:
The LCD displays 3 variables:
	Measured RPM, notated by 'M_RPM' shows the calculated RPM from the tachometer signal.
	Desired RPM, notated by 'D_RPM' shows the input desired fan speed from the encoder.
 	Button State, notated by 'B' shows the button state varaible to control encoder sensitivty.
